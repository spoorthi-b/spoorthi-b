- 👋 Hi, I’m Spoorthi Badikala
- 👀 I’m a Software Engineer with a Master’s degree in Computer Science from the University of California, Riverside and over three years of experience building scalable, secure Identity and Access Management (IAM) solutions. My work focuses on designing reliable systems through end-to-end web applications, REST APIs, and microservices. At Align Technology (Invisalign), I’ve led projects that modernized IAM infrastructure, including migrating 600K+ users to a new platform, developing self-service tools to streamline operations, and implementing observability frameworks that reduced platform incidents by 97%. I’m passionate about solving complex engineering challenges, learning continuously, and contributing to products that make a meaningful impact. I take pride in being adaptable, curious, and always eager to grow while delivering high-quality solutions in collaborative, fast-paced environments.
